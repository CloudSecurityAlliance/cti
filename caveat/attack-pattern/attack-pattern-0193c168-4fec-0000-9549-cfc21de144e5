  "description": "Adversaries may modify the Serial Presence Detect (SPD) chip on DRAM modules to bypass security protections in AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP) technology. This technique involves either physical tampering using low-cost hardware ($10 Raspberry Pi) or software-based manipulation on certain vulnerable DIMM models to make memory modules report false capacity information. This causes address aliasing that allows unauthorized access to protected memory regions, enabling attackers to compromise the integrity of encrypted virtual machines and forge attestation reports.",
